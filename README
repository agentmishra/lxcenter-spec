Spec files for HyperVM and Kloxo

These RPM packages are created to get rid of external tarball/zip packages.
In the future you can install and keep up to date with the products with yum.

At some point every LxCenter builded package is showed here.

Packager: Danny Terweij <d.terweij-at-lxcenter.org>
